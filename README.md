## Services:
- A user can check the interactions between multiple medications by their brand names
- The interactions are explained in two different ways (Consumer and Professional) 
- A user can save medications to his profile and can have multiple medication profiles
- The user gets notified when he adds another medication to the profile and it interacts with the old medications
- A user can add medications to a cart and place an order to buy them, then track the status of the order

## Issues:
- The servers are down, so the application is unusable at the moment.
